# gRPC Template
is a template for both gRPC client and gRPC server microservice
# Usage (works on Linux, not sure about other OS)
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the fork to your PC
3. make cert
4. Insert all required data to get your localhost certificate
5. docker-compose up
6. Access API via localhost:5055, don't matter with or without TLS
# TLS certificates
## Generating
Certificates are generated by openssl commands in certs/cert-gen.sh,
so you can edit this file as well as certs/server-ext.cnf to configure
it for your needs
## Storing
Both CA and server cetificates will be stored inside certs directory after
you generate them.
In code they are stored in /etc/ssl directory because of the the docker compose
volume, which you, sure, can edit as you like
